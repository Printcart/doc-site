## How to

### How to set up your account
The first thing you need to create a master account for yourself — sometimes called an Printcart Account. You can ask for developer support when signup, forking the platform, and setting up your iteration of Printcart. You just need to supply the developer with the details of your main administrator and the setup password.

### How to access your dashboard
Once you have your store, you can access the administration panel by:
Access link https://dashboard.printcart.com/signin and login.
Access directly to https://dashboard.printcart.com/ if your browser already remembers login information.
Clicking dashboard on the right side of the top navigation bar of your store’s front page


### How to reset your password
In case you forget your password, the dashboard login page allows you to reset it in a few simple steps:

- Click the "Lost password?" link on the login page and provide the same email address used when creating your account.
- A message will be sent to that address with a link redirecting you to a password change page.
- Once you input your new password, you will be directed back to the login page where you can use it to log in.
